Starting experiments with Single Class:

Loss is Tversky + BSE (.float for target); BSE is still computed separately for axes and plots; U-Net is finished by Sigmoid.

The Goal is to receive a good segmentation and fit it with a singly polynomial.

Result: could not segment plots after 300 steps; wtf

Will now try dice_coefs = 0.999 to see how Dice alone can do the task
